# UWB sensing lab

Wifi sensing object movement lab in Telecom Sudparis 2024 Autumn semester, "IoT, Ubi-comp and data analysis" course. 

## First experiment - movement

To launch analysis over MATLAB run these two files:
1. `movement/movement.m`
2. `movement/radargram.m`

To launch analysis over PYTHON - run `python movement/movement.py`

## Second experiment - breathing

To launch analysis over PYTHON - run `python respiration/respiration_analysis.py`

## Third experiment - apnea

To launch analysis over PYTHON -  run `python apnea/apnea.py`
